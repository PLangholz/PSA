        <h2>What glmpse needs...</h2> 
        <p>
            Right now, glmpse is a phenomenal request/response interaction. But the users deserve more out of glmpse. We want a complete, full, conversation through a glmpse interaction. We don't want users feeling cut-off or for them to have to use other mediums (text, phone, email) to complete an interaction that began on glmpse. 
            <br />
            With this in mind, we feel the need to enhance some aspects of our current design.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Enhance the way glmpse requests are sent
                    <ul>
                        <li>allow users to send prompts with their requests</li>
                        <li>suggest certain prompts</li>
                        <li>allow users to see many different genres of prompts to choose from or gain inspiration from</li>

                    </ul>    
                </li>

                <li>
                    Close the loop: transform a simple request/response formula into a complete, fulfilling and satisfying interaction.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allow the requester to leave a comment as feedback for the provider of the glmpse</li>
                        <li>Maybe this is not enough. Maybe we will allow a more open, less restrained dialogue to take place around a glmpse.</li>
                        <li>How do we best do this?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Acclimate and Orientate new members. a better onboarding experience
                    <ul>
                        <li>How do we best show a new user around the app to familiarize them with how to use it</li>
                        <li>We want to show them both experiences: requesting a glmpse and responding to one</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    glmpsing with more than one person at a time?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users have suggested that a more complete experience would be had if you could glmpse 1-to-many</li>
                        <li>We could implement a feature where you can request a glmpse from a user on behalf of your friends. that way, the response gets sent to a group of people and you can all interact.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>


            </ul>
