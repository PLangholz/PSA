            Staying connected with someone isn't about pushing content out to a social network. It isn't about broadcasting your photos to the world. It isn't about monthly Skype sessions during which you exchange facts.
            </p>
            <p>
            Staying connected with someone is about getting a taste for their life. It's about experiencing the physical space they inhabit and hearing the sounds they hear. It's about a window into someone's life. It's about glimpses.
